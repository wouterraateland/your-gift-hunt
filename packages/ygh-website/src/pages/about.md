# Our Mission

Your Gift Hunt aims to provide the best way to create scavenger hunts leading to gifts that connect the creator and the player of the hunt by means of adventure, personal puzzles, connecting with friends, and through other interplay that occurs during such a scavenger hunt.

# Our story

The idea for Your Gift Hunt came to existence around two weeks before my birthday. That morning, I found a letter on my bed. A letter from my girlfriend, containing two things: a riddle and puzzle piece. This puzzle piece would be the first of many. During the two weeks before my birthday, I collected the pieces from places all over, from different friends, and finally on my birthday, I completed the jigsaw puzzle. Only to find a hint to the actual present... This puzzle was not over jet.

A few months later, it was my girlfriend her birthday and I decided to make her work for her present even harder. That was when I created my first version of the scavenger hunt. In the form of an online puzzle and she loved it. This laid the foundation for Your Gift Hunt.

I cannot wait to see what you make and I hope that it will bring you as much connection and joy as it did to me.
